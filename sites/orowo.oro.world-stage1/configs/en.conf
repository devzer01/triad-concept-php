This is possible between the portal and the user's mobile phones and works in the following ways:<br/><br/>- From your member's area to mobile phone<br/>- From the mobile phone directly to the inbox of your chat partner<br/>- From mobile phone to mobile phone<br/><br/>Therefore, your chat partner is always available for you and vice versa."
